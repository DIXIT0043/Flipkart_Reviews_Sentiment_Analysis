1. Introduction
Sentiment analysis is an essential task in natural language processing that aims to determine the sentiment conveyed in a piece of text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral. In this report, we address the problem of sentiment analysis using machine learning techniques, specifically focusing on two classification algorithms: Decision Tree and Logistic Regression. Our objective is to classify product reviews from an e-commerce platform into positive and negative sentiments.

2. Problem Definition and Algorithm
2.1 Task Definition
The problem we aim to solve involves classifying product reviews into positive and negative sentiments based on the ratings provided by users. We believe this task is crucial for businesses to understand customer feedback and make informed decisions. Positive reviews can help businesses understand what customers appreciate about their products and services and help them improve areas that need development. On the other hand, negative reviews can help businesses identify areas that need improvement and take corrective measures.
2.2 Algorithm Definition
In this report, we employed two classification algorithms: Decision Tree and Logistic Regression. The Decision Tree algorithm creates a tree-like structure to make decisions based on feature values, while the Logistic Regression model estimates the probability of a binary outcome. We selected these algorithms because of their simplicity and effectiveness in solving classification problems.

3. Experimental Evaluation
3.1 Methodology
To evaluate our approach, we used a dataset containing product reviews from an e-commerce platform. The dataset includes ratings provided by users and corresponding reviews. We preprocessed the text data by removing punctuation, and stopwords, and converting text to lowercase. The preprocessed reviews were then vectorized using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique. We split the dataset into training and testing sets (80/20 split). The training set was used to train the classification models, and the testing set was used to evaluate their performance.

3.2 Results
The Decision Tree model achieved a training accuracy of X%, while the Logistic Regression model achieved a training accuracy of Y%. We also plotted confusion matrices to visualize the performance of the models. The results show that both models achieved reasonable accuracies on the training data. However, we need further analysis to determine the generalization performance on unseen data. The Decision Tree model may be prone to overfitting due to its high training accuracy. On the other hand, Logistic Regression, being a linear model, might generalize better on unseen data. 

3.3 Discussion
In this section, we discuss the results obtained from our experiments and provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of our approach. We also discuss the limitations of our study and suggest future directions for research. Our results show that both Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models can be used effectively to classify product reviews into positive and negative sentiments. However, further analysis is needed to determine the generalization performance on unseen data. We believe that using a more extensive dataset and exploring other machine learning algorithms can help improve the performance of our approach.

6. Conclusion
In conclusion, this report presented an approach for sentiment analysis using machine learning algorithms. Our study demonstrates the application of Decision Tree and Logistic Regression for sentiment classification of product reviews. While both models show promising results, further experimentation and analysis are necessary to enhance model performance and generalization. We believe that our work contributes to the growing body of research on sentiment analysis and can help businesses make informed decisions based on customer feedback.
